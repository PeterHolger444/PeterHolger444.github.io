  <h1>Essay Review: The Question Concerning Technology</h1>

  <div class="review">
    <h2>"The Question Concerning Technology" by Martin Heidegger</h2>
    <p>In the essay, Heidegger explores the concept of technology and how it relates to us. He considers how people in ancient times understood technology by analyzing the word. He found that technology is not just a tool but it's a way of understanding reality. It frames us into a particular mode of being. It "enframes"(Gestell) us — makes us see nature, people, and even ourselves as resources. When everything is reduced to utility, we lose important aspects of life and live inauthentic life. However, Heidegger suggests a paradox: the essence of technology contains the possibility of salvation.</p>

    <p>The writing style is complex and difficult to read, especially if you're unfamiliar with some of the philosophical concepts mentioned in the essay.</p>

    <p>Overall, it is a challenging yet rewarding read for those interested in the relationship between modern technology and humanity.</p>
